**Selection Sort**
1. Create a standart loop iterating from 0 (i) to end of the array
2. Set the minimum to current value
3. Create an inner loop starting from i + 1 till the end of the array
4. Update the minimum if lower value found during the single iteration
5. Outside of the inner loop swap minimum value with current
6. You can write conditional to swap only if current value and minimum aren't eq.
